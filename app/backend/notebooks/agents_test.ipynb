      "We have prior hypotheses and probabilities. We received most recent test: Fuel Level Check, result \"not empty\". We must update probabilities multiplicatively.\n",

      "We need to determine how the result 'not empty' affects each hypothesis. Let's analyze each hypothesis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Starter Motor Failure: If starter motor fails, engine cranks but doesn't start. Fuel level irrelevant. Fuel level not empty indicates that fuel isn't the problem. So result does NOT support Starter Motor Failure; it doesn't contradict it either? Actually, a not-empty fuel means engine may crank but still not start due to other issue. The result does not influence starter motor failure: it's neutral. So factor ×1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fuel Delivery Problem: This is contradicted by not empty fuel? Fuel delivery problem might be fuel pump or filter, but fuel presence doesn't rule out delivery issues; but if fuel tank not empty, fuel can still not be delivered. The result provides some information: not empty fuels doesn't strongly support but maybe some contradiction? Not really. It's neutral or some support? Since fuel delivery problem implies lack of fuel to engine; fuel tank not empty means fuel is present, but the problem may be delivery, e.g., pump. But the test is about level. It's somewhat neutral. We'll use neutral factor ×1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ignition System Failure: Not affected by fuel level. Neutral. ×1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Low Battery: Starter cranks; low battery would cause weak cranking or no cranking. Fuel level irrelevant. Neutral. ×1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Engine Seizure: The engine revs but doesn't start; engine seized implies mechanical lock. Fuel level irrelevant. Neutral. ×1.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "So all neutral. No changes. Probabilities unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe we can consider some support for Fuel Delivery Problem? Since fuel level not empty still leaves possibility of delivery; but it's not strong. But the rule says we must choose one of the categories. We'll keep neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus updated probabilities same as prior. No new hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we must choose next test to reveal most information with least effort. Current possibilities: Starter Motor Failure, Fuel Delivery Problem, Ignition System Failure, Low Battery, Engine Seizure.\n",
      "\n",
      "What test would differentiate? Since we know fuel is present, we might test the ignition system: e.g., check spark plugs or ignition coil. Or test battery voltage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we could test the spark presence: spark test. That would differentiate between ignition failure and other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "But also we could test the starter motor: e.g., remove battery, try to cranking with a helper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe better: Check battery voltage under cranking. Because if battery is low, the starter may still crank but engine not start; but battery low might also cause weak cranking. But user said engine revs when keys turned. That's a normal cranking, not weak. So battery low might not be the main issue. But we might test battery voltage to rule out low battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we want most informative test. Let's consider each hypothesis and what test can confirm or deny:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Starter Motor Failure: test by listening for clicking sound or measuring starter current draw. If starter is okay, then engine should crank; if not, no sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fuel Delivery Problem: test fuel pressure at the filter or fuel pump.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ignition System Failure: test spark at plugs, test ignition coil.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Low Battery: test battery voltage >12.6 V; test cranking amps.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Engine Seizure: test engine movement: attempt to turn the engine manually with a wrench.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the truck is revving but not starting, engine might be seized; but usually if seized, the starter won't crank at all. So engine seizure might not cause revs; but they say it revs (so cranks). So engine seizure unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "So next test: Check battery voltage under cranking. That will rule out low battery and maybe provide info about battery health. But battery low is less likely because engine revs normally. But still possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, check spark at plugs. That would test ignition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we might first test battery voltage because it's simple: measure with voltmeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's see: Which test yields more info? Battery voltage tells us if battery is strong; spark test tells if ignition works. If battery is fine, then we can focus on ignition or fuel delivery. But we can also combine: check both. But we need single test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the prior probabilities: Starter Motor Failure 2.0, Fuel Delivery Problem 2.0, Ignition System Failure 1.2, Low Battery 0.5, Engine Seizure 0.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could design a test that splits between two leading hypotheses. For example, checking spark will differentiate between ignition failure vs others; but if spark present, that eliminates ignition failure but still could be fuel or starter. But if spark absent, that points to ignition failure. That seems informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, testing fuel pressure will differentiate fuel delivery. But we need to also test ignition. So maybe spark test is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus next test: \"Spark Test\". We'll ask user to remove a spark plug wire and test for spark at plug while cranking. Outcome: spark present, spark absent, or uncertain. If present, rule out ignition failure. If absent, support ignition failure. This is straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, battery voltage test: outcome high or low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which yields more? If spark present, we rule out ignition failure; if absent, we support ignition failure. That reduces probability. So yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus choose \"Spark Test\".\n",

      "We must output JSON with updated probabilities unchanged, and next_test details.\n",
