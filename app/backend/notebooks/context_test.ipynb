      "We have no prior hypotheses. We need to create a list of possible issues that could cause: truck revs up (idle) when key in ignition but won't start. That's a common symptom of starting issues: battery, alternator, starter, fuel, spark, etc. We should assign initial probabilities. Use simple estimation. Let's create plausible hypotheses: \"Bad Starter\", \"Weak Battery\", \"Fuel Pump Failure\", \"Ignition Coil Failure\", \"Bad Spark Plugs\", \"Engine Seized\", \"Low Engine Oil\", \"Faulty Ignition Switch\". Provide short descriptions. Assign base probability scores: maybe use 1.0 as base for each? But we need unnormalized scores. Could give different initial scores. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bad Starter: 1.5\n",
      "- Weak Battery: 1.2\n",
      "- Fuel Pump Failure: 1.0\n",
      "- Ignition Coil Failure: 0.8\n",
      "- Bad Spark Plugs: 0.6\n",
      "- Engine Seized: 0.5\n",
      "- Low Engine Oil: 0.4\n",
      "- Faulty Ignition Switch: 0.3\n",
      "\n",
      "We have only one test, the issue description. That test provides some support for many. The outcome \"revs up when I put the keys in the ignition but won't start.\" This suggests maybe the starter is not engaging? But revs up indicates engine crank? Actually revs up means the engine cranks? In many trucks, if you turn key, the engine cranks (revs) but doesn't start. That could be fuel or spark. So \"Fuel Pump Failure\" or \"Ignition Coil\" get strong support. The battery might still be fine because engine cranking indicates battery ok. But maybe battery low but still cranking? Usually low battery can still crank? Might be some contradiction for weak battery? Not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's decide test result provides strong support for \"Fuel Pump Failure\" and \"Ignition Coil Failure\". Some support for \"Bad Starter\" (but starter would not crank). Actually the engine revs means starter is engaged. So \"Bad Starter\" is contradicted. So we apply strong contradiction ×0.5 for that hypothesis. For \"Weak Battery\" maybe neutral? Because engine cranks, battery probably ok, but could still be low? But not strong contradiction. We can set neutral. For others, assign support.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we only need to update probabilities from the current test. The rules: Multiply each hypothesis by factor depending on test result: strong support ×2.0; some support ×1.2; neutral ×1.0; some contradiction ×0.8; strong contradiction ×0.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we need to decide for each hypothesis factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's define support:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fuel Pump Failure: strong support (engine revs but won't start suggests lack of fuel). ×2.0\n",
      "- Ignition Coil Failure: strong support (no spark). ×2.0\n",
      "- Bad Spark Plugs: some support. ×1.2\n",
      "- Bad Starter: strong contradiction (starter would not engage). ×0.5\n",
      "- Weak Battery: neutral (since cranking suggests okay). ×1.0\n",
      "- Engine Seized: some contradiction? Engine revs implies not seized. So contradiction. Some contradiction ×0.8\n",
      "- Low Engine Oil: contradiction? No relation. Neutral. ×1.0\n",
      "- Faulty Ignition Switch: contradiction? Might cause no start but cranking? But ignition switch is turning key. If faulty might not crank. So contradiction. ×0.8\n",
