      "We have initial scenario: issue description: truck revs up when keys in ignition but won't start. Need to produce initial updated_probabilities: we have no prior hypotheses. We must generate plausible issues. Use test result: revs up but won't start suggests battery, alternator, starter, fuel, ignition, engine mechanical. So hypotheses: battery failure, faulty starter solenoid, bad spark plugs, clogged fuel filter, failed fuel pump, ignition coil failure, ECU issue, immobilizer, etc.\n",

Test result: revs up but won't start. That supports battery? Wait battery is the cause of no start: battery dead? But revs up means engine cranks? Actually revs up: the engine revs up when keys in ignition but will not start. If the starter is cranking, then battery is likely ok. But if battery is weak, engine may not start. But revs up suggests cranking. So test result supports: Starter motor fine? Actually if the starter works, battery is likely fine. So battery failure contradicted. Starter failure supported? If starter is defective, engine may not crank, but here it revs up. So starter fine. So this test outcome likely supports ignition, fuel, or mechanical issues. So we need to decide for each hypothesis factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can approximate: Battery failure: contradiction -> ×0.5 (strong contradiction). Starter failure: contradiction -> ×0.5. Fuel pump failure: support -> ×2.0 (strong support). Ignition coil failure: support -> ×2.0. Spark plug: support -> ×2.0. ECU: some support? Maybe neutral. Immoblizer: contradiction? maybe neutral.\n",

Perhaps ask user to listen to fuel pump.\n",
      "\n",
      "But test could be \"Perform a fuel pressure test at the fuel rail\" to see if fuel is reaching engine. That would differentiate fuel pump vs ignition issues. That's a common test.\n",

      "But to be simpler, a test: \"Does the engine crank normally? (listening to starter)\". But we already know revs up. Next step: \"Check if the engine starts after applying spark\" but no.\n",

      "We can propose: \"Check spark at cylinder 1 using spark tester\". That will tell if ignition is present. But also expensive? Could be done by user with tool? Might be more complex.\n",
