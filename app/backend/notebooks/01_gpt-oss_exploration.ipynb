      "We need a poem with first letters spelling \"gpt-oss\". So 7 lines: g, p, t, -, o, s, s. But '-' is not a word. We can handle hyphen: first word of line should be \"g\", \"p\", \"t\", \"oss\"? Actually \"gpt-oss\" contains hyphen; maybe 6 lines: g, p, t, o, s, s but need hyphen? The prompt says first word of each line should spell out gpt-oss. We can incorporate hyphen as part of the first word on one line: e.g., line 4 first word \"–\"?? But that's not a word. Maybe use \"gpt-oss\" as one line? But need each line spells out letters. Could do 6 lines: \"g\", \"p\", \"t\", \"o\", \"s\", \"s\" and incorporate hyphen in title? Maybe first line \"g\" but maybe phrase \"g\" as first word. Could do: \"g\" is not meaningful. Better to use \"g\" as \"G\", maybe \"G\" as first word \"G\" but a word \"Go\"? Might cheat. Could do 6 lines with first letters G P T O S S. That spells GPTOSS not GPT-OSS. The hyphen maybe considered separate. We could include hyphen as separate line: first word \"–\" but not a word. Could treat hyphen as separate line with first word \"—\" but not good.\n",

      "Better approach: we can write 7 lines; first words: \"G\", \"P\", \"T\", \"—\", \"O\", \"S\", \"S\". But \"—\" not a word. But maybe we can put \"—\" as first word \"—\" but that might break. Perhaps we could include hyphen in one of the words like \"G\" \"P\" \"T-oss\" as a line. But need each line first word spells out gpt-oss. The hyphen might be included within a word. Eg, line 4 first word \"—\" not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe they expect 7 lines: g, p, t, -, o, s, s. The hyphen line could start with a dash as first character, like \"-\". But dash is not a word. But they said \"first word of each line\". Could use \"—\" as word? Possibly okay. Or we could write line starting with \"-\". It might satisfy. Alternatively, we could incorporate hyphen as part of the first word of line 4: \"—\" cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Better: Use 6 lines: g p t o s s. They might accept that hyphen omitted. But to keep strict, maybe we could treat hyphen as part of \"o\" line: first word \"o-\". Eh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe just 7 lines with first words: \"G\", \"P\", \"T\", \"O\", \"S\", \"S\". Wait that's 6. The hyphen is not needed. But the prompt explicitly says gpt-oss. We'll produce 7 lines: line1 starts with \"G\", line2 \"P\", line3 \"T\", line4 \"–\" (just a dash?), line5 \"O\", line6 \"S\", line7 \"S\". Might be accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's write creative poem about gpt-oss. We'll start each line with those words. For dash line, we can start with \"-\" then a space? Might look like a line with dash. We'll produce:\n",
